### The following streamlit project contains two modules
1) knowledge graph construction from free text using LLM Graph Transformers.<br/>
2) Chat with the constructed knowledge graph using the LLM graph cypher chain.<br />
**Note: This is example and there are ways where we can improve both the knowledge graph construction and communication modules**

### Getting started
1. Install neo4j-desktop and create a neo4j-graph. <br />
2. Install all of the libraries imported in the kgrag.py file<br />
3. You need an open-api key for this project <br />
4. add your neo4j-graph credentials and open-api key in the kgrag.py file. <br />
5. run: streamlit run kgrag.py
